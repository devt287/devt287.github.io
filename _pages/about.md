Hello, my name is Devin Tang. I'm a junior student majoring in Honor Mathematics and Computer Science at New York University. My research interests lies in biostatistics, Bayesian machine learning, and computational neuroscience.

Currently, I am working with Professor [David McLaughlin](https://math.nyu.edu/~dmac/) on computational neuroscience research related to STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity） and BTSP (Behavioral Time Scale Plasticity）. I am also studying machine learning in biological PDE under the supervision of Dr. MingTao Xia.
