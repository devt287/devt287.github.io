Hello, my name is Devin Tang. I'm a junior student majoring in Honor Mathematics and Computer Science at New York University. My research interests lies in statistical machine learning, high dimensional statitiscs, reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience.

Currently, I am working with Professor [David McLaughlin](https://math.nyu.edu/~dmac/) on computational neuroscience research related to STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticityï¼‰ and BTSP (Behavioral Time Scale Plasticity. I have done the supervised reading under supervision of Professor [John Rinzel](https://as.nyu.edu/cns/people/faculty.john-rinzel.html) on modeling of auditory perception. I have also worked with Professor [Yanjun Han](https://yanjunhan2021.github.io/) in analysis for the phase transition of method of moment matching. I am also advised by Professor [Tyler Chen](https://research.chen.pw/) on randomized algorithm.

Besides academic, i enjoy playing basketball, soccer and batminton, and i am a huge fan of [Real Madrid](https://www.realmadrid.com/en). I also love hiking, angling,and hip-hop music.
