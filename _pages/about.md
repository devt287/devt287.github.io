Hello, my name is Devin Tang. I'm a junior student majoring in Honor Mathematics and Computer Science at New York University. My research interests lies in statistical machine learning, high dimensional statitiscs, and computational neuroscience.

Currently, I am working with Professor [David McLaughlin](https://math.nyu.edu/~dmac/) on computational neuroscience research related to STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticityï¼‰ and BTSP (Behavioral Time Scale Plasticity. I have also worked with Professor [John Rinzel](https://math.nyu.edu/people/profiles/RINZEL_John.html) on computational models of auditory perception.

Besides academic, i enjoy playing basketball, soccer and batminton, and i am a huge fan of [Real Madrid](https://www.realmadrid.com/en). I also love hiking, angling,and hip-hop music.
